     <h2>About me!</h2>
        <p>
        I'm Tom, a recent graduate from the University of Washington majoring in Geography with a minor in Informatics.
        I am passionate about creating things that look either pretty, simple, and functional. I believe things should look visually appealing while also holding on to the concept of simplicity.
        </p>
        <p> I am currently seeking work! I'm good at front end developing, and if there's anything I don't know, I will learn.</p>
        <p> Aside from coding I care about things such as diversity, inclusion, education, music, geography, community, tea, and cats.</p>
        <p>My hobbies include working out, building keyboards for others, cooking, hiking, and petting cats!üêà </p>
